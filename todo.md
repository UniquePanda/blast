# doing:
- fix reasignment (change reasignment at stack location)
  - test with binary operations!
  - add such reassignments to test.bla

# basic todos:
- pointers
- comparison operators ("==", "!=", "<", ...)
- additional unary operations (e.g. !)
- while loops
- for loops
- arrays
- functions
- objects/structs
- classes
- add typing?
- optimizer for produced asm

# specific ideas/bugs/refactorings/etc:
- remove condensing of multiple plus/minus (e.g. "----5" should throw an error instead of being used as "+5")
- add const as opposed to let?

# done:
- add line numbers to error messages
- fix calculations with same operator precedence
- +/- unary operators
- reassign identifiers
